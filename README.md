# MAGIC_Gamma_Telescope

machine learning model is designed to classify high energy gamma particle registrations in ground-based atmospheric Cherenkov gamma telescopes. By analyzing patterns and parameters derived from recorded Cherenkov radiation, including image elongation, asymmetry, cluster extent, and total deposition, the model can effectively discriminate between primary gamma signals and background noise caused by cosmic ray showers.
